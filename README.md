Project Name: Decision Tree Classifier ML Model v1.0

I have recently started looking into machine learning models in python using scikit-learn and decided to create some small personal projects to test out the various models and think of ways to implement them into my career. This will be the first of many ML projects I will be working on in 2023.

- For this project, I found a dataset on kaggle that included ecommerce behavioral data from a multicategory store.
- I used python in Google Colab to track my process.
- I first imported the dataset then analyzed and cleaned the data using pandas library.
- Then I began the process of splitting the data into training/test sets before training the model and asking it to make predictions.
- Once the model is trained, I asked it to make some predictions about what brands a customer might buy and what interaction they might have based on product types and prices.
- I tested the accuracy using the created test datasets.
- I was able to get the accuracy around 98% at its best with the dataset I used.
- Finally, I visualized the decision tree using sklearn.tree.plot_tree to help better understand the models decision making process.
